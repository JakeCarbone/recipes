# Kim-bonara Recipe

## Intro

Kimchi in Carbonara what more to say

## Ingredients 

**Note:** There are a lot of salty ingredients in this so be careful about tasting before adding any extra salt/salty pasta water

* Salt
* 2 large eggs and 2 large yolks
* 1 ounce (28g) grated pecorino Romano, plus additional for serving or just more parmesan if you don't have it
* 1 ounce (28g) grated Parmesan
* Coarsely ground black pepper
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 3½ ounces (85g) of slab guanciale, pancetta or bacon, sliced into pieces about ¼ inch thick by ⅓ inch square. If using guanciale cut off the peppery outter skin
* 12 ounces (340g) spaghetti or ramen/odon noodles to lean into the asian theme
* About 100g good quality kimchi to taste
* Two Spring onions finely chopped

## Instructions

### Step 1

Place a large pot of lightly salted water over high heat, and bring to a boil.

### Step 2

Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium high heat, add the pork, and sauté until the fat just renders, on the edge of crispness but not hard. Remove from heat and set aside keeping the melted fat.

### Step 3

In a glass or metal mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, yolks and pecorino and Parmesan and a bit of the pork fat. Season with a generous amount of black pepper. If the sauce is gloopy, put the bowl over the pot of boiling water and keep wisking until smooth.

### Step 4

Add pasta/noodles to the water and boil until a bit firmer than al dente. I also like to add some hot water to the serving bowles to warm them up if its cold.

### Step 5

Just before pasta is ready, add the pork to a pan over low heat. Mix in the sauce then add the kimchi and the spring onions. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water, then drain pasta and add to the pan. Gently stir everything for a minute or so. 

Taste and add reserved pasta water if needed for saltyness, if the sauce isn't creamy enough but salty enough, add plain water. Serve immediately, dressing it with a bit of additional grated pecorino and pepper.
